# Gun Violence Dataset (2013 - 2018)

## Context:
Gun violence is a serious problem that affects communities, and entire societies. Despite its impact, there’s still a lot we don’t fully understand, partly because detailed data can be hard to find. This project is here to help change that by making gun violence data more accessible so we can better study it and work toward solutions.

## Dataset: 

This dataset contains **260,000+ gun violence incidents** in the US from January 2013 to March 2018.

## What's in the dataset?

The CSV includes: 
- Details about incidents (date, location, etc.) 
- Info about the people involved 
- Geolocation data for mapping 

## How was the data obtained:

The data comes from [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/). They’re a non-profit dedicated to tracking gun violence in the US.
